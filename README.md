<p style="text-align:center;"><i>"Blocker Fraude Company is a company specialized in fraud detection in financial transactions made through mobile devices. The company has a service called ‚ÄúBlocker Fraud‚Äù with guarantee of blocking fraudulent transactions."</i></p>

<p>The company's business model is of the service type with monetization made by the provider's performance, that is, the user pays a fixed fee on the success in the detection of service fraud of the customer's transactions.</p>

<p>You have been hired by a DS consultancy to create a highly accurate and accurate model for fraud detection of transactions through mobile devices. You need to deliver an API with access to the model and also the answers to the following questions:</p>

> *1. What is the precision and accuracy of the model?*
> 
> *2. How reliable is the model in classifying new transactions?*
> 
> *3. What is the company's expected revenue if 100% of the transactions are classified with the model?*
> 
> *4. What is the price expected by the company if the model fails?*
> 
> *5. What is the expected profit for using this model?*

<h3>0.1. What is a Service</h3>

<p>Service is a business model like consultory, the company make a work and receive a profit based on her work results. For example, the Blocker Fraud Company, In Brazil, the company start with a new method of services to get some new clients based only on your "Blocker Fraud" model.</p>
<p>At Blocker Fraud it is B2B, Business to Business, Blocker Fraud offers the service to other businesses like banks and finance houses</p>

> *1. The company will receive **25%** of the value of each transaction that is **truly detected as fraud**.*
> 
> *2. The company will receive **5%** of the value of each transaction **detected as fraud, however the transaction is truly legitimate**.*
> 
> *3. The company will refund **100%** of the value to the customer, for each transaction **detected as legitimate, however the transaction is truly a fraud**.*

<p>For the customer it is an excellent deal, although the fee charged for the service is very high above 25% of success, the company will reduce its costs with fraudulent transactions detected as true frauds, but it will have a loss caused by the error in the service that will be covered by the own company.</p>
<p>In addition to attracting new clients from Brazil, with this risky strategy of guaranteeing reimbursement in case of failure, it specifically depends on the precision and accuracy of the model in carrying out these detections.</p>

<p>B2B Metrics is very important, let's check some ones!</p>

<h3>0.2. What is a Fraud</h3>

<p><i>"Wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain."</i>~ Wiki</p>

<p>Fraud is an intentionally deceptive action designed to provide the perpetrator with an unlawful gain or to deny a right to a victim. In addition, it is a deliberate act (or failure to act) with the intention of obtaining an unauthorized benefit, either for oneself or for the institution, by using deception or false suggestions or suppression of truth or other unethical means, which are believed and relied upon by others. Depriving another person or the institution of a benefit to which he/she/it is entitled by using any of the means described above also constitutes fraud.</p>

<p>Types of fraud include tax fraud, credit card fraud, wire fraud, securities fraud, and bankruptcy fraud. Fraudulent activity can be carried out by one individual, multiple individuals or a business firm as a whole.</p>

<p>More Examples of Fraud:</p>

1. Data theft on fake websites.
2. Purchase of physical facilities.
3. Document change.
4. Computer data theft.
5. Interception of goods.
6. Phishing.
7. Bots and Stealing Files.
8. Receipts of or benefits not granted.
9. Ethics Violations.
10. Conflict of interests.
11. Appropriation or misuse of resources eg Supplies.

<p>Fraud involves the false representation of facts, whether by intentionally withholding important information or providing false statements to another party for the specific purpose of gaining something that may not have been provided without the deception.</p>


<h3>0.3. Fraud in Financial Transactions</h3>

<p>A financial transaction is an agreement, or communication, between a buyer and seller to exchange goods, services, or assets for payment. Any transaction involves a change in the status of the finances of two or more businesses or individuals. A financial transaction always involves one or more financial asset, most commonly money or another valuable item such as gold or silver.</p>


<h4>0.3.1. Types of Transactions</h4>

<h5>0.3.1.1. Cash Transactions</h5>

<p>A cash transaction is any transaction where money is exchanged for a good, service, or other commodity. Cash transactions can refer to items bought with physical money, such as coins or cash, or with a debit card. These differ from credit transactions because the money is immediately taken from the buyer and given to the seller.</p>
<p>A cash transaction stands in contrast to other modes of payment, such as credit transactions in a business involving bills receivable. Similarly, a cash transaction is also different from credit card transactions.</p>

<h5>0.3.1.2. Transfer</h5>
<p>A transfer is the movement of assets, funds, or ownership rights from one place to another. Is also used to describe the process by which ownership of funds or assets are reassigned to a new owner. Banking, brokerage, cryptocurrency, asset titles, and loan transfers are a few examples of domains and transaction types where transfers occur.</p>

<h5>0.3.1.3. Debit</h5>
<p>A debit card payment is the same as an immediate payment of cash as the amount gets instantly debited from your bank account.</p>
<p>Debit cards allow bank customers to spend money by drawing on existing funds they have already deposited at the bank, such as from a checking account. A debit transaction using your PIN (personal identification number), is an online transaction completed in real time. When you complete a debit transaction, you authorize the purchase with your PIN and the merchant communicates immediately with your bank or credit union, causing the funds to be transferred in real time.</p>
<p>In a credit card payment made by you, the amount is not debited from your bank account instantly. However, you are able to buy the product within your credit limit under the credit card. You need to make payment only after the generation of your credit card bill</p>

<h5>0.3.1.4. Payment</h5>
<p>An act initiated by the payer or payee, or on behalf of the payer, of placing, transferring or withdrawing funds, irrespective of any underlying obligations between the payer and payee.</p>


 
<h2>1. Solution Strategy and Assumptions Resume</h2>
<hr>

<p>The first problem finded is the massive size of dataset. The Dataset Info you can check below.</p>

<table>
  <tr>

  <tr>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>6353307</td>
  </tr>

<h3>1.1. First CRISP Cycle</h3>

<ul>
  <dl>
    <dt>Data Cleaning & Descriptive Statistical.</dt>
      <dd>The first step in data science projects is clean the dataset and check rows datatypes and fix simple wrong inputs. After dataset clean, the step is check with simple statistics methods the dataset behavior with (mean, median, std, skew, skew, kurtosis).</dd>
    <p>In this step I get some insight's and inconsistencies, you can check in this image below. 0 Transaction and 0 Median to newbalance_orig, the perpetrator clean the account.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>newbalance_orig <b>Median</b></td>
        <td>Amount <b>Min</b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0.0</td>
        <td>0.0</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <dt>Feature Engineering.</dt>
      <dd>In this step, with coggle.it to make a mind map and use the mind map to create some hypothesis list, after this list, I have created some new features based on differencies, like origin and destination balance diff, merchant flag and day based on "step" feature.</dd>
    <dt>Data Filtering.</dt>
      <dd>In first cycle I only selected a range of values to amount because in "big" transactions, in the dataset do not exists fraud on high values of transaction.</dd>
    <dt>Exploratory Data Analysis.</dt>
      <dd>In this step I deep dive in the dataset to shear for behaviors in three steps, the Univariable, Bivariable and Multivariable analysis to detect Fraud comportements, validation of bussiness hypothesis and correlations.</dd>
  </dl>
</ul>

<h2>2. Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<hr>

<h3>2.1. EDA On First Cycle</h3>

<p>I divide the EDA into three steps, univariable, bivariable and multivariable steps, In the univariable I check the target and all the characteristics (categorical and numerical), In the Bivariable, this step I validate 8 Business Hypotheses and in the Multivariable it is the correlations and the pair diagrams</p>

<p>Principal Results</p>

1. Usually after fraudulent transactions, all money is withdrawn from the destination account.
2. Only Transactions and Debit types have fraudulent activities.
3. The dataset does not follow a standard cash flow due to the simulator that generated the data.
4. There is not much information related to CASH-OUT to answer item 3, it can be assumed that the chash-out is a transaction worth 0 and therefore has some value that does not follow a flow.
5. the numerical variables have a distribution that can be seen by applying the log.
6. There is a spike in fraudulent transactions at the beginning of the simulation month.
7. Fraudulent transactions do not have negative diff in origin based on amount.
8. The larger the transaction, the more susceptible it is to fraud.

<h3>2.2. Top 3 Eda Insights</h3>
<hr>

<p>1. Debit transactions represent more than 50% of fraud cases.</p>

<p>3. 80% of fraud cases happen when the destination of the transaction already has money in the account.</p>
