<p style="text-align:center;"><i>"Blocker Fraude Company is a company specialized in fraud detection in financial transactions made through mobile devices. The company has a service called “Blocker Fraud” with guarantee of blocking fraudulent transactions."</i></p>

<p>The company's business model is of the service type with monetization made by the provider's performance, that is, the user pays a fixed fee on the success in the detection of service fraud of the customer's transactions.</p>

<p>You have been hired by a DS consultancy to create a highly accurate and accurate model for fraud detection of transactions through mobile devices. You need to deliver an API with access to the model and also the answers to the following questions:</p>

> *1. What is the precision and accuracy of the model?*
> 
> *2. How reliable is the model in classifying new transactions?*
> 
> *3. What is the company's expected revenue if 100% of the transactions are classified with the model?*
> 
> *4. What is the price expected by the company if the model fails?*
> 
> *5. What is the expected profit for using this model?*

<h3>0.1. What is a Service</h3>

<p>Service is a business model like consultory, the company make a work and receive a profit based on her work results. For example, the Blocker Fraud Company, In Brazil, the company start with a new method of services to get some new clients based only on your "Blocker Fraud" model.</p>

> *1. The company will receive **25%** of the value of each transaction that is **truly detected as fraud**.*
> 
> *2. The company will receive **5%** of the value of each transaction **detected as fraud, however the transaction is truly legitimate**.*
> 
> *3. The company will refund **100%** of the value to the customer, for each transaction **detected as legitimate, however the transaction is truly a fraud**.*

<p>For the customer it is an excellent deal, although the fee charged for the service is very high above 25% of success, the company will reduce its costs with fraudulent transactions detected as true frauds, but it will have a loss caused by the error in the service that will be covered by the own company.</p>
<p>In addition to attracting new clients from Brazil, with this risky strategy of guaranteeing reimbursement in case of failure, it specifically depends on the precision and accuracy of the model in carrying out these detections.</p>
